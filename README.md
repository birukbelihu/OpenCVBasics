# OpenCV Basics

Basics Of The Famous Open Source, Cross Platform Computer Vision Library Called OpenCV In Python

# About OpenCV

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a comprehensive library for real-time computer vision, image processing, and machine learning tasks. It provides a wide range of algorithms and functions to handle various computer vision tasks, including object detection, facial recognition, motion tracking, and more. Originally written in C++, it's now available in multiple languages like Python, Java, and MATLAB, with a strong focus on performance and efficiency. Which Is Also Supported On Major Operating Systems(Windows, Linux & macOS).
This Repository Covers The Basics Of This Amazing Library Which Will Help You Get Started In To The Journey Of Computer Vision.

# Motivation

I've Created This Project When I Start Learning Computer Vision As A Reference Which Helps Me A Lot From The Start To Now. Later I Taught Sharing This Will Help Many Others Like You As It Helped Me.

I've Tried To Make The Repository Free Of Errors & Easy To Understand. If You Find Any Errors Or Have Any Suggestions Please Open An Issue Or Create A Pull Request.

# Running

To Get Started With OpenCV Basics On Your Local Machine Follow This Simple Steps One By One To Get Up & Running.

Make Sure You Have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [Python](https://python.org) Installed On Your Machine.

```
git --version
```

```
python --version
```

# Reminder
You Can Use Whatever Code Editor(VS Code, Sublime Text Even Python IDLE) You Use. But I Recommend Using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) Python IDE For The Best Experience(In Fact The Repository Was Created Using PyCharm)

### With PyCharm

Copy The Repository URL

```commandline
https://github.com/BirukBelihu/OpenCVBasics.git
```

Go Back To PyCharm, Click On Clone Repository, Paste The Copied Repository URL & Clone. It Handles Everything From Installing Packages From Requirements Text File To Preparing The Project For Running & Other Stuffs.

### Without PyCharm

Clone The Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/BirukBelihu/OpenCVBasics.git
```

Go Inside The Project

```
cd OpenCVBasics
```

Install Required Dependencies(OpenCV, Numpy)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run Any Of The Program You Want(For Instance Reading An Image)
```
python read_image.py
```
